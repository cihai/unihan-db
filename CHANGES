## unihan-db 0.6.x (unreleased)

- _Insert changes/features/fixes for next release here_

### Internal

- Update unihan-etl 0.14.0 -> 0.16.0:

  - unihan 0.15.0 adds `--no-cache` / `cache` as an option
  - unihan 0.16.0 adds type annotations (`mypy --strict`)

## unihan-db 0.5.0 (2022-08-20)

### Breaking changes

- Bump in unison with other cihai projects deprecating compat modules, via #299.

  Python 2.x was already dropped in 0.2.0 (2021-06-15). There was no compat
  module in this project, and it only only removed a duplicate function
  (`merge_dict()`) and imported the one from `unihan_etl`.

  - Bump unihan-etl to 0.15.0+ (to avoid any chance of using compat imports from
    it in the future)

## unihan-db 0.4.0 (2022-08-16)

### Compatibility

- Drop python 3.6 (#292)
- Add python 3.10 (#292)

### Development

Infrastructure updates for static type checking and doctest examples.

- Update poetry to 1.1
  - CI: Use poetry 1.1.7 and `install-poetry.py` installer (#274, #292)
  - Relock poetry.lock at 1.1 (w/ 1.1.7's fix)
- Tests: `tmpdir` -> `tmp_path`
- Run pyupgrade @ python 3.7
- Initial [doctests] support added, via #297

- Initial [mypy] validation, via #297

- CI (tests, docs): Improve caching of python dependencies via
